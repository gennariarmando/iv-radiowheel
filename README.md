# Radio Wheel IV
This plugin replaces the Radio Hud with a Radio Wheel from GTA V.

# Compatibility
Compatible only with GTA IV The Complete Edition.

# How to install
Grab [latest](https://github.com/gennariarmando/iv-radiowheel/releases) archive. \
Move "RadioWheelIV.asi" in the root or "plugins" folder, and "radiowheel.wtd" in "./pc/textures" or "update/pc/textures" folder. \
Enjoy

# Warning
The input for opening the wheel is the same as the "Previous Radio Station" input, default is set to "Wheel Dn", in this way \
you will only be able to quick cycle between radio stations, to open the Radio Wheel instead you need \
to map this input to another key from your keyboard. ("Q" in GTA V)
